Q1-. Write a python program to generate Calendar for the given month and year?. 

import calendar
year=int(input("please enter the year:"))
month=int(input("please enter the month:"))#enter month in 03 format
print("the calendar of:",calendar.month(year,month))

Q2 Write a Python program to implement Depth First Search algorithm. Refer the following graph as an Input for the program. [Initial node=1,Goal node=7].

graph = { 
     '1': ['2', '3'], 
     '2': ['4'], 
     '3': ['2'], 
     '4': ['5','6'], 
     '5': ['3','7'], 
     '7': ['6']
 } 
  
 # DFS traversal function 
def dfs(graph, start, visited): 
     if start not in visited: 
         print(start, end=' ') 
         visited.add(start) 
         for neighbor in graph[start]: 
             dfs(graph, neighbor, visited) 
  
 # Main function to initiate DFS traversal 
def main(): 
     start_node = '1'  # You can change the starting node here 
     print("Depth-First Search Traversal:") 
     visited = set() 
     dfs(graph, start_node, visited) 
  
if __name__ == '__main__': 
     main()
